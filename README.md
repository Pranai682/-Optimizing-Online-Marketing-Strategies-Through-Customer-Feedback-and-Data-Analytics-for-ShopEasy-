# **Optimizing Marketing Strategies Through Data Analytics**
## Project Overview:


This project focuses on analyzing marketing performance data for ShopEasy, an online retail business, to address key challenges such as reduced customer engagement, declining conversion rates, and inconsistent feedback scores. Using data analytics, actionable insights were derived to improve marketing strategies, optimize content performance, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
 ### ShopEasy faced the following challenges:
1)Decreased Conversion Rates: Fluctuating rates with notable dips in specific months.

2)Reduced Customer Engagement: Declining social media interactions and low content performance.

3)Inconsistent Customer Feedback: Average ratings below target, indicating room for improvement.

## Goals
1)Increase Conversion Rates.

2)Identify factors affecting conversions and optimize the conversion funnel.

3)Enhance Customer Engagement.

4)Determine the types of content driving the highest engagement and suggest improvements.

5)Improve Feedback Scores.

6)Analyze customer reviews to address pain points and boost satisfaction.


## Key Insights & Actions
1)Conversion Analysis: Identified peak-performing product categories (e.g., Ski Boots, Kayaks) and recommended seasonal promotions.

2)Engagement Analysis: Proposed interactive content formats (e.g., videos, user-generated content) to boost declining views and low click-through rates.

3)Customer Feedback Analysis: Used sentiment analysis to extract themes from reviews, focusing on addressing mixed and negative feedback.

# Process Overview
This project followed a structured data analysis process involving SQL, Python, and Power BI for end-to-end insights and recommendations.

## 1. Data Analysis with SQL
### Process:
SQL was used to clean, preprocess, and analyze the raw data. Optimized queries were written to extract meaningful insights, such as identifying seasonal trends, conversion rates, and product performance.
### Highlights:
Aggregated and filtered large datasets to calculate metrics like conversion rates, customer engagement, and average ratings.
Used advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs, JOINS, and WINDOW FUNCTIONS to streamline the analysis process.
